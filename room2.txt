RoomNumber= 2
Name= Court
Description= As I move through the door, the stale air of the room gives way to a comparatively fresh one. I've found myself in an ornate court yard of sorts. Outside, but unable to see the sky through the thick fog. What I can tell is that there are walls on each side far too high for me to scale. In the center of the court yard is a fountain. On the north side of the yard is an armored beast, which stands in front of an exit.
