RoomNumber= 2
Name= Court
Description= The player enters an ornate area and notices both a fancy water fountain and an exit to the north. This exit is blocked by a monster that is quite large, but very slow and old. The player should refill their flask here, as it won’t be close to full after getting it and drinking from it in the first room. They can also drink from the fountain itself. They will need to kill the monster. It poses no threat beyond it’s ability to preclude further progress. Upon killing it, the player will have the option to take its entrails (which he or she will need later).
