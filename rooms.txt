Description= Ugh...where am I? Face down on a stone floor and it's so blasted hot...As I get up I notice that I'm in a midieval style room made of stone. Their are no windows, the only sources of light are torches on the wall. There's a wooden chest a short distance from me. In the corner, there seems to be the silhouette of a person, but it's hard to focus on it. I'm so damn thirsty. There is a door on the eastern side of the room. I'm in the room I first woke up in. I see a wooden chest and the silhouette of a person. The room is lit by torches that show no signs of going out. An exit lies on the eastern side of the room.
