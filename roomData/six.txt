As I enter the room I notice the oddly unfurnished nature of it. It's like the
person moving in got started but gave up on their task almost immediately. 
There's an ugly PAINTING on the northern wall, some SHELVES, and a TABLE. 
That's it. The dust on the ground suggests the latter two have been MOVEd 
recently. There's also another place on the wall to hang a PAINTING. The 
existing PAINTING could be placed there. There's an exit back to the south, but
that's back the way I came. There's got to be another, right? Or else I'm in a 
dungeon from which there's no exit. But how would the builders have gotten out 
without an exit?
@@
I'm back in the room I had to escape from. The painting, shelf, and table are
still there. An exit is to the south and...maybe the north?

It's an extremely ugly painting of an old woman. It looks like you could MOVE
it elsewhere. There's even another place on the wall you could put it.
@@
The painting sits on the other part of the wall.
@@
I pick up the painting and move it to the other spot. Hey, the old hanging spot
had a door behind it!

It's a set of bookshelves covered in dust. I could MOVE it if I needed to.

The shelves sit in their new location, unused as ever.

I push the shelves across the room. Nothing happens.

It's an old wooden table. I could MOVE it easily.

The table sits in its new place.

I push the table a few feet to the right. Nothing happens.
