I enter the room and see DEAR LORD! An unnaturally large HOUND is racing
towards me, only to get stopped when it reaches the end of its leash. As I start
to calm down, I notice the HOUND has a collar around its neck. That collar is
connected to a chain, the only thing that stopped me from becoming the
creature's lunch. I back as far away from it as I can, trying to ignore its
piercing barks. As I do, I notice a PICTURE on the wall. I can return to the 
exit to the south. There's an exit on the west side of the room, but if I try
to go through it the HOUND will get me. I can already tell there's no way I
can kill that thing before it kills me...

I'm back in the HOUND room. The HOUND remains there, as does the picture. There
is an exit to the south, where I came from when I first entered the room. 
There's also the exit on the western side.

It's a picture that seems to show someone giving something to a HOUND. Maybe I
should INSPECT it more closely.

The picture remains there, with the same picture of someone offering GUTS to a
HOUND

The picture shows a man FEEDing the HOUND what looks like some entrails(GUTS). It's kind
of gross

The HOUND barks at me ferociously, and tries its best to get me. I'd better do
something to get past it but what? There's no way I can stab it before it gets
me.

The HOUND continues to grin happily at me. Apparently we're best buddies now.

I take the GUTS from my bag, noticing the hound pause and stare intently as I
do so. Not wanting to get too close, I toss the entrails to the HOUND's feet. It
eats them at an alarming speed. When done it turns towards me, finally snaps
the chain holding it and...proceeds to lick my hands. It then looks at me with
a big grin, licks the spot on my cloths where I wiped my hands earlier, and
licks my face. Panting, the beast lies down and continues to look at me with a
goofy grin on its face.
