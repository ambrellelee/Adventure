As I enter the next room, I notice it seems surprisingly clean. All around me
are various mirrors, which leaves me disoriented. The mirrors make it clear,
as one might suspect, that the trials I've faced left me less then presentable.
Regardless, I look around and see an exit to the east. Other exits are the one
I came from, to the west. Unfortunately, there's a rather large lock holding the
eastern door closed.
@@
The mirror room remains as clean and disorienting as ever. The mirrors are there
and the lock still hangs from the door.

A key I somehow got from the mirror.

Maybe it opens the lock in the mirror room?

Looking into the mirrors I notice what at first seems like exactly what one
would expect, images of the room as well as reflections of other mirrors. Maybe
I should study what I see in the reflections more closely.
@@
The same reflections are there. That key sure is weird. Maybe I should take it.
@@
All of the normal reflections are there, nothing out of the ordinary.

I begin to think that someone must have been extremely vain to need this many
mirrors...but then I notice something in the reflection. It's a large key near
where I'm standing. Strange, as the key doesn't seem to actually be there...
@@
I crouch down and reach out with my hand, keeping an eye on where the key in
the reflection is in relation to my hand. Once I get the reflection of my hand
above the key-reflection, I close my hand and feel it as my reflection starts
to grab it. I look down, and see they key in my hand now! I put it in my bag.

It's a large padlock hanging from the door, it is in locked position

The padlock still hangs there, but it is unlocked now!

I take the key I found, put it in the lock, and turn it. I hear a distinct
