As I enter the room I notice the sheer opulence of the room. Various treasures lie
throughout the room, as do many other valueables. Basically, it looks like
someone had gone through the rest of the dungeon and taken anything of value
that wasn't nailed down. The most salient detail is a demonic KNIGHT standing
near the center of the room. It looks quite threatening but doesn't seem to
move at all. There is also a glowing PANEL on the wall with an indentation
in the shape of a hand. The exit back to the south is still there. There's a 
door to the west, but I'm not sure I can get to it without fighting that KNIGHT.

I'm back in the demonic swordsman's room, who still stands there amidst the 
valuables. The panel is still there. Exits are to the south and the west.

It stands poised and ready but motionless. There's no way I'm just darting
past this guy if he chooses to ATTACK. I should get rid of him.
@@
The knight has been wounded by my attack, but now he's swinging his sword at
me. I'll need to BLOCK that thing.
@@
The knight is off balance. Now's my time to finish him off! ATTACK!
@@
The knight stands immobile. Defeated, and no longer a threat
@@
As I approach the knight it raises its weapon, but I'm quicker. The sword
wounds him greatly, making him stagger back. With surprising speed, he launches
a counter attack with his own flaming sword.
@@
I block the attack, but am scorched by the flames from the knight's weapon. 
Blocking the attack has caused my foe to be knocked off balance.
@@
I raise my sword again, slashing at the knight. It lets out a cry of defeat as
I do so, retreating away from the exits and going immobile once more.

It's a glowing green panel with the imprint of a hand in it. Maybe I should
TOUCH it.

The panel remains but has lost its glow.

I reach out and put my hand in the panel's hand imprint. As I do so my hand
glows green and I feel completely healthy again.
