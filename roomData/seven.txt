I enter what would appea to have been a lounge of sorts. The furniture is far
too broken down to rest on. There's still a basin in the centre of the room
with some water in it. There's also a book shelf with several books on it.
One in particular looks...off somehow. There's no obvious new exit, but I could
return to the south

I'm back in that room with the basin of water in it. The exits haven't changed

It's a basin of water. Despite the run down nature of the room, the water
inside looks clean.

At first glance it might look like a regular book on a book shelf, but further
inspection casts doubt on that. It looks like it's connected to the shelf as a
lever...

The fake book is on the bookshelf, which is out of the way of the door.

I try to grab a book, but as I pull it I hear the sound of a switch being
pulled. The book shelf swings out of the way, revealing a new exit to the north.
