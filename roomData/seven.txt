I enter what would appear to have been a lounge of sorts. The furniture is far
too broken down to rest on. There's still a BASIN in the centre of the room
with some WATER in it. There's also a BOOKshelf with several BOOKs on it.
One in particular looks...off somehow. There's no obvious new exit, but I could
return to the south.

I'm back in that room with the basin of water in it. The exits haven't changed.

It's a basin of water. Despite the run down nature of the room, the water
inside looks clean. I can FILL my FLASK with the WATER from the BASIN.

I scoop up the water in my flask.

At first glance it might look like a regular BOOK on a BOOKshelf, but further
inspection casts doubt on that. It looks like it's connected to the shelf as a
lever, maybe I should PULL the BOOK out...

The fake book is on the bookshelf, which is out of the way of the door.
@@
I try to grab a book, but as I pull it I hear the sound of a switch being
pulled. The bookshelf swings out of the way, revealing a new exit to the north.
