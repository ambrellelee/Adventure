As I enter the room, I notice it is lit with the same lanterns I've become 
accustomed to. The room is full of various statues and paintings, all of which
are clearly too large for me to cover. Salient among these things is a box, a
chest, and a vault. All of them would seem to be openable. Maybe I should take
a look.
@@
I'm in the treasure room again. The box, the chest, and the vault are still
there.

It's a key, presumably to something in this dungeon...

It probably unlocks something near where I found it

It's hard to say what good currency could do down here. Maybe if I have to bribe someone?

An ordinary wooden chest. Maybe there's something inside?

The chest is open now. There is steel-plated armor inside!

Once again I notice the chest is unlocked. Security sure is lax around here. I
open it up and notice there is something inside.

I reach into the chest and pull out the armor. It could fit in my seemingly 
bottomless bag, so that's where I put it.

A rather well maintained vault. It has a combination based lock.

I put my ear against the vault door, listening carefully. I slowly turn the 
dial as appropriate, eventually finding the right numbers. And here my mom said
I wasted those 10,000 hours I spent learning to crack safes...Regardless, I 
notice it's full of some enticing treasure!

I continually grab handfuls of coins, transfering them to my bag as I do so.
