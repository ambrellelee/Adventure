I enter a room that was clearly once a library. The shelves are there, but it
is clear that time has ravaged this place. The leather-bound tomes look to be
falling apart, and they're all coated with dust. Only two books would seem to be
intact. On one, I can make out the word "magic." On the other I can make out
the word "fight." In addition to the exit back to the south, there's one to
the north.

I'm in the old library again. The magic book and the fight book are still on
their shelves.

It's a leather-bound book. The only legible word on the spine is "fight." I

The fight book's remnants are where I left them.

I open up the book, thumbing through is pages until I find something intriguing.
It reads "...and the switch must be hit before one with such power can be
harmed, or else all attacks will be for naught..." Maybe that will come in
handy. This book is clearly much too weak to take with me though. I put it back
on the shelf, noticing the book fall apart as I do so.

It's another leather-bound book. The spine bears the word "magic," as well as
some others that are no longer decipherable. I wonder if any passages remain
legible.

The remains of the magic book are where I left them.

I grab the book and open it. As I flip through the pages, I finally find one
with a legible paragraph. It says "...but the true magic against such fiends
is their own lust for wealth. I was astonished to find th[illegible]" Hm...
not exactly the tome of fire spells I'd hoped for. Regardless, the thing is
falling apart on me. I put it back on the shelf.
