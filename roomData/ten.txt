As I enter the room, I see...not much. It is very dark in this area. One thing's
clear, it smells terrible. There is a distinct smell of sulphur in here. I can
also hear geysers, which I see in a pit in the centre of the room. If the
humidity is any indication, that water must be rather hot. There would seem to
be a large statue in front of you, but you can't make out much about it.
@@
I'm back in that horrible-smelling room. I can still hear the sound of water
being expelled as though it is from a geyser. The form of the statue is still
barely visible.

It's so dark I can't see much of anything. I could illuminate it by lighting
a torch inside, so long as I don't have to be worried about the heat of the
flame...

I can see in the alcove now! The rear part of it looks like a switch that could
be pushed
@@
The now-illuminated alcove remains undisturbed, the back part was a switch that
I have now pressed.

Using the heatless torch I found earlier, I illuminate the alcove by lighting 
the torch inside it. I can see the alcove much better now, and notice that the
back looks like a pressure-sensitive panel
@@
I push the back of the alcove. As I do so, I hear the sound of a series of 
mechanisms going off. It sounds like something is breaking and I get worried.
As I look over I see the statue fall forward. Thanks to the light from the
alcove, I can see that it has fallen on the geysers. The force of the geysers
pushes the statue up, but I should be able to walk across it like a bridge.

They look just like I would expect geysers to look. You can feel their heat
just being near them.

Those awful geysers are still there. No way am I touching those again!

I reach and and touch the water. It hurts badly! I'm not doing that again!
