As I enter the room, I hear some rather strange breathing. Like snoring, but
somehow intimidating. As I enter I see why, there is a sleeping dragon there.
It has a wooden box and a passageway behind it. The dragon shows no signs of
waking up. Even so, getting past this thing will be no easy task, I don't even
have a ring that will make me inivsible...regardless, that passageway to the
north would seem to be my way out of here.
@@
I'm back in the dragon room. The monster continues to slumber. The box is still
nearby. Exits continue to be through the northern passageway and to the south.

It's a wooden box. There wouldn't seem to be any way to open it, but it looks
fragile...

The box is busted open. There's a potion inside!

The broken box remains on the floor

I put my foot on the box...sweating bullets as I watch to see that the dragon
remains asleep. I slowly increase the pressure I'm putting on the box until it
breaks beneath my weight. As I withdraw my foot, I notice that there is a
potion inside the box.
@@
I reach into the busted box slowly, ever cautious of the sleeping dragon. I
grab the potion, slowly put it into my bag, and back away.

It is a large slumbering dragon. It looks fast asleep.

The dragon continues to sleep. It really is a deep sleeper.

I'm unsure whether I should sneak by crouching down or getting on my tip-toes.
Eventually, I end up doing a bizzare combination of both as I move around the
dragon. Apparently I'm more sneaky than I give myself credit for, because it
doesn't wake up. I can leave through the passageway (i.e to the north) now!
