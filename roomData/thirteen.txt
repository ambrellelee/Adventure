As I enter the room, I notice a faint green glow that illuminates everything.
The walls are covered in hieroglyhics. Man, the person designing this dungeon
sure seems to have lacked a sense of direction when it came to decorating...
Regardless, I notice a PLATFORM with something floating atop it. To the north
I see a door, but in the way is a statue of a SPHINX. I can always go back east.
@@
I'm back in the sphinx room. The platform is still there, as is the sphinx
statue. Exits are to the east and the north.

Atop the platform, I see a glass case covering an area in which there is a
floating green ORB. That ORB looks valuable. Maybe I should REMOVE the PLATFORM?
@@
With the glass case removed, the ORB floats free on the platform. Ripe for the
taking.
@@
The platform lacks the ORB now, making it seem much less impressive.
@@
I grab the glass case, gently pick it up, and put it to the side.
@@
I reach out and grab the ORB. Upon grabbing it, I immediately feel stronger.

The SPHINX's eyes seem to have followed you since me since I entered the room.
Maybe I should INVESTIGATE this thing more.

The sphinx sits poised, waiting for an answer to "what walks on four
legs, then two, and then three?" (hint: 3 letter answer.)

The SPHINX sits motionless.

As I approach the SPHINX, a voice calls out asking "what walks first on four

The sphinx comes to life, only to move out of the way and return to stone.
