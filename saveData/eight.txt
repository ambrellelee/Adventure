An intense wave of heat assaults me as I open the door to the next room. As I
make my way inside I notice a dark atmosphere, lit as much by the glow of a pit
of lava as it is by the few lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The pit sits
between me and the other sides of the room. The eas side would appear to have
a door, but I know I can't jump far enough to get over the lava and to the
platform in front of the door. There is an ALCOVE nearby on the wall, with
something that shines brightly. Next to it is a LEVER of some kind.
@@
I'm back in the lava room. The lever and the alcove are still there on the
south side of the room. THe lava looks as threatening as ever. It is still very
hot.

A torch that shows no signs of going out. The fire isn't hot to the touch and burns nothing.

This could help light my way!

It's an ALCOVE in the wall. There's a burning TORCH inside I could TAKE.
Strangely, I feel no heat from it.

It's a stone alcove. It remains empty.

I reach in and grab the torch. Strangely enough, the flames don't seem to give
off any heat. In one of my more reckless moments, I put my hand over the flame,
and feel no pain. Similarly, it doesn't burn my bag, so I put the torch inside.

It's a LEVER on the wall. Presumably, PULLing it should do something

The lever has been pulled down. I sure am glad I pulled it!.

I grab the lever and start to pull. At first there's no give, but then I feel
it start to move. Using much effort, I managed to pull the lever all the way
down. As I do so, a bridge extends from the platform on my side of the room to
the one in front of the eastern exit. I can leave now!
