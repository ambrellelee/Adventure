As I move through the door, the stale air of the room gives way to a
comparatively fresh one. I've found myself in an ornate court yard of sorts.
Outside, but unable to see the sky through the thick fog. What I can tell is
that there are walls on each side, each of which are far too high for me to 
scale. In the center of the court yard is a fountain. On the north side of 
the yard, I can just barely make out the form of a large monster. It is too
close to the exit for me to just stroll past it.
@@
I'm in the court yard again. The fog is still thick. The pristine fountain
continues to stand in the center. The form of the monster remains near the
north side.

The innards of the monster in the court yard.
@@
The creature's guts are full of fluid. The odor is quite pungent and reminds you of dog food.

It is a very finely crafted water fountain. There doesn't seem to be any
new water coming in, but its basin is full of clear, fresh water.
@@
The fountain is empty now, still apparently without any source of water.
@@
I gather up the water in my flask, which is full now.

As I take a closer look at the monstrous guard, I notice how worn out it
looks. The beast seems old and slow. It wears tattered armor.
@@
The old guard lies dead on the floor with a gaping wound in its chest, its
guts spilled out on the floor. I can't help but notice its bizzare innards.
They seem to have absorbed quite a bit of water, and give off a smell not
unlike the old Nutro pet food factory...
@@
The guard's corpse lies on the floor. Without the guts you took, the corpse
has animals crawling in to feast on the meat.
@@
I charge forward and slash at the beast with my sword. It falls, with its
internal organs spilling out from its chest.
@@
I reach in and pull out some of its organs, then stuff them into my bag. I
briefly look down at my hand afterwards. The sight and smell of the bits
stuck to my hand remind me of the time I ate dog food as a child. I
shudder at the memory, wiping my hand clean on my pants.
