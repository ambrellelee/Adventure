Ugh...where am I? Face down on a stone floor and it's so blasted hot...As I get
up I notice that I'm in a midieval style room made of stone. Their are no
windows, the only sources of light are torches on the wall. There's a wooden
chest a short distance from me. In the corner, there seems to be the silhouette
of a person, but it's hard to focus on it. I'm so damn thirsty. There is a door
on the eastern side of the room.

I'm in the room I first woke up in. I see a wooden chest and the silhouette of
a person. The room is lit by torches that show no signs of going out. An exit
lies on the eastern side of the room.

Initially it seems like a rather ordinary wooden chest, but upon closer
inspection you notice the distinct picture of a water droplet painted on its
front side. That reminds you of just how thirsty you are.
@@
It's an open chest. There appears to be a flask inside.
@@
It's an empty wooden chest.
@@
As I grasp the chest's lid, I notice that it isn't locked. How fortunate! I
open the chest and notice there is something inside.
@@
I reach into the chest and grab the flask, which is surprisingly cool given
the temperature of the room.

silhouette

It is quite distinctly the silhouette of a man. Strange, considering there seems
to be no source casting a shadow.
@@
It speaks! It offered help in a way that didn't feel particularly warm. Even so,
given the circumstances, it would be unwise to not ask for help.
@@
The silhouette's shadowy hand holds a sword with the handle facing me. The way
it offered help made it unclear whether the help was for me or my enemies. Even
so, getting a sword COULD go a long way towards making me feel safe.
@@
The shadowy figure is swiping its sword at me. I need to defend myself!
@@
The figure is off balance after I blocked its attack. Now is the perfect time
to counter.
@@
The silhouette stands motionless.
@@
I look towards the silhouette and say "hello." Upon doing so the silhouette
turns his head to look at me. "The road ahead is fraught with foes," says the
shape in a flat, lifeless tone, "I can help."
@@
"Please, offer me what help you can." I say to the silhouette, immediately
wondering why I bothered with manners towards something so clearly indifferent
to them. Regardless the shape's shadowy hand reaches out from the wall, holding
a sword. "Take this with you," the shape drawled, "it is imperative for the
struggles ahead. Remember that it can be used to block other attacks as well as
performing your own."
@@
Still wary of the mysterious shape before me, I slowly start to reach out for
the sword. Then, quite quickly, I snatch it and take a step back, not sure of
what to expect. Suddenly, the shape leaps out from the wall, taking on the form
of a three dimensional-yet still shadowy, brute. Its arm morphs into the shape
of a sword and the former-silhouette swings it at you!
@@
I hold up my sword in the path of the brute's sword. The foe's sword hits mine,
and the impact takes the brute by surprise. It stumbles back, off balance
@@
I swing my sword at the form as hard as I can. Probably not the best technique,
but the blade hits home. The form lets out a piercing howl, retreating to the
wall and returning to its silhouette form.
