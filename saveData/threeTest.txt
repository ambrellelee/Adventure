As I move through the door, I notice the fresh air is replaced by a stale
one. The smell is similar to that of the room I woke up in, but contains
a hint of old, worn parchment. Like the smell of a library if it had been
abandoned for a thousand years. I notice this room is very well lit, thanks
to lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The walls are covered with maps, but none
of them seem to feature familiar lands. In the centre of the room is a
glass case that seems to have something displayed prominantly within it.
There is also a table with a plate and (hopefully) some food on it.
@@
I'm back in the map room. The glass case is still there, as clean as ever.
The table reamains, unmoved. The lanterns burn as brightly as ever. I wonder
briefly about how they keep going, but find it best not to focus on it.

An assortment of fresh food. A freshly cooked steak, a salad and some fruit.

Somehow, the food shows all signs of being safe and ready to eat!

It's a map of a dungeon. Presumably this one, given that the rooms I've been in seem to match up with ones featured on the map.

Studying this might give me an idea of what lies ahead...

The table is clean. Surprisingly clean given how dusty everything in this room
seems to be. On top of it lies a full meal,  placed atop some fabric
that could be bunched together to function as a sack.
@@
The table is bare now. Still quite clean of course.
@@
I reach over, fold the four corners of the cloth over the food, and tie them
together. Then, I place the sack in my bag.

The case is covered in dust, but I can see in it well enough to tell that
there seems to be a map inside. Maybe one I can use? I notice the lid looks
easy enough to open. It doesn't even have a lock.
@@
The case is open now. Nothing's stopping me from getting that map if I want it
@@
The case remains empty and open.
@@
I reach up and carefully open the case. As I remove the lid, a cloud of dust
bursts in my face, making me sneeze. I feel like I should have seen that coming.
@@
I reach into the case and grab the map. I fold it neatly and put it in my bag.
